# landmark_classifier
this project is a python based application that classify many landmarks from around the world.

<br />
During this project, we tried to create a Deep Learning model from scratch using pytorch and train it on landmark images.
<br />
Then, we used a pretrained model and we compared the accuracies of each model to finally use the best one in our app.
